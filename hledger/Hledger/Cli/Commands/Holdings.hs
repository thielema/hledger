The @holdings@ command shows a report of investment holdings (lot-tracked assets).

Work in progress; see doc/SPEC-holdings.md.
Currently it shows the Date, Age, Units, Unit/Avg cost, Price, Cost,
Value, Weight, UGain, UGain%, RGain and XIRR columns, one row per
account (or lot subaccount, with --lots) and held commodity.
