Flags:
  -l --flat                 list/tree mode: show accounts as a flat list
                            (default). Amounts exclude subaccount amounts,
                            except where the account is depth-clipped.
  -t --tree                 list/tree mode: show accounts as a tree. Amounts
                            include subaccount amounts.
     --no-elide             in tree mode, don't squash boring parent
                            accounts; in list mode, also show parent accounts
                            (usually zero, hidden without -E)
     --full-names           in tree mode, show full account names instead of
                            indented leaf names
     --drop=N               in list mode, omit N leading account name parts
  -S --sort-amount          sort by value (or cost) instead of account name,
                            largest first
  -N --no-total             omit the final total row
     --round=TYPE           how much rounding or padding should be done when
                            displaying amounts ?
                            none - show original decimal digits
                            soft - just add or remove decimal zeros
                                   to match precision
                            hard - round amounts to precision (default)
                            all  - also round cost amounts to precision
  -O --output-format=FMT    select the output format. Supported formats:
                            txt, csv, tsv, html, fods, json.
  -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE. A file extension matching
                            one of the above formats selects that format.

Query arguments and report flags like `-t/--tree`, `--depth`, `-S/--sort-amount`, `--title` etc. work as usual.
The columns show:

- each holding's acquisition date (or earlier basis date) and age
- the number of units held
- the unit cost basis (or average cost; for accounts using the AVERAGE method, this is the pool's running average on the report date),
- the unit market price on the report date
- the total cost
- the total market value
- the percentage of the portfolio's total value (Weight)
- the unrealised gain and gain percent (UGain, UGain%)
- the realised gain from disposals so far (RGain)
- and the annualised rate of return (XIRR, calculated from the holding's dated cashflows and current value, like roi's IRR; it includes realised gains).

Fully disposed commodities and accounts are not shown, unless you add `-E/--empty`.
(But the RGain and XIRR in the totals row always includes them.)

To see a commodity's performance, a market price should be declared for it (as of the report end date).
Market prices come from [P directives](#p-directives) or (with `--infer-market-prices`) from transacted prices, as usual. 
Each lot is valued in its cost commodity.
In a multi-currency portfolio, aggregated values may contain multiple currencies; use `-X COMM` for a single-currency view.

With `-V`, `-X COMM` or `--value` ([Valuation](#valuation)), holdings
are valued in the default or given valuation commodity instead, and the
cost columns are also converted to it (at the valuation date, so percent
gain is unaffected). Cashflows are not converted, however, so the XIRR
column is left blank for holdings whose cashflows are in a different commodity.
`--value=then` is not supported, and `-B/--cost`has no effect.

Amounts are displayed with their commodity's display precision.
`--round` can select another rounding strategy.
The percent columns (Weight, UGain%, XIRR) are shown with with the display style configured for the `%` commodity (eg by `-c '0.00 %'`).

With `-O html`, an HTML table is produced instead.
With `-O fods`, a spreadsheet document readable by LibreOffice etc. is produced.
With `-O csv` or `-O tsv`, machine-readable output is produced instead:
one record per displayed row, with full account names, age in days,
bare units and gain percent numbers, gain and gain percent as separate fields, and no totals records.
With `-O json`, a JSON array of holding objects is produced.
