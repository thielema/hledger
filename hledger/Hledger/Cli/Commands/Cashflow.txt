financial statements.

                            balance value (caused by deposits, withdrawals,
                            market price fluctuations)
     --gain                 show unrealised capital gain/loss (historical

     --cumulative           accumulate amounts from report start (specified
                            by e.g. -b/--begin) to column end
  -H --historical           accumulate amounts from journal start to column
                            end (includes postings before report start date)
  -l --flat                 show accounts as a flat list (default). Amounts
                            exclude subaccount amounts, except where the
                            account is depth-clipped.
  -t --tree                 show accounts as a tree. Amounts include
                            subaccount amounts.
     --drop=N               flat mode: omit N leading account name parts
     --declared             include non-parent declared accounts (best used
                            with -E)
  -A --average              show a row average column (in multicolumn
                            reports)
  -T --row-total            show a row total column (in multicolumn reports)
     --summary-only         display only row summaries (e.g. row total,
                            average) (in multicolumn reports)
  -N --no-total             omit the final total row
     --no-elide             don't squash boring parent accounts (in tree
                            mode)
     --format=FORMATSTR     use this custom line format (in simple reports)
  -S --sort-amount          sort by amount instead of account code/name
  -% --percent              express values in percentage of each column's
                            total
     --layout=ARG           how to show multi-commodity amounts:
                            'wide[,WIDTH]': all commodities on one line
                            'tall'        : each commodity on a new line
                            'bare'        : bare numbers, symbols in a column
     --base-url=URLPREFIX   in html output, generate hyperlinks to
                            hledger-web, with this prefix. (Usually the base
                            url shown by hledger-web; can also be relative.)
  -O --output-format=FMT    select the output format. Supported formats:
                            txt, html, csv, tsv, json.
  -o --output-file=FILE     write output to FILE. A file extension matching
                            one of the above formats selects that format.

This report shows accounts declared with the Cash type (see account
types). Or if no such accounts are declared, it shows accounts

-   under a top-level account named asset (case insensitive, plural
    allowed)
-   whose name contains some variation of cash, bank, checking or
    saving.

More precisely: all accounts matching this case insensitive regular
expression:

^assets?(:.+)?:(cash|bank|che(ck|que?)(ing)?|savings?|currentcash)(:|$)

and their subaccounts.

An example cashflow report:

$ hledger cashflow
Cashflow Statement 2008

                    || 2008 
====================++======
 Cash flows         ||      
--------------------++------
 assets:bank:saving ||   $1 
 assets:cash        ||  $-2 
--------------------++------
                    ||  $-1 

This command is a higher-level variant of the balance command, and
supports many of that command's features, such as multi-period reports.
It is similar to
hledger balance assets not:fixed not:investment not:receivable, but with
smarter account detection.

This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are txt, csv, tsv (Added in 1.32),
html, and json.
